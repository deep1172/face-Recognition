# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Overview
This project implements a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python, OpenCV, and face recognition libraries. The system captures video frames from the default camera, detects faces, and matches them against a pre-defined list of known faces. The attendance of recognized students is recorded in a CSV file along with the timestamp.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- numpy

You can install the required Python libraries using:
=>bash
pip install opencv-python face-recognition numpy
=>

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   =>bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-attendance.git
   cd face-recognition-attendance
   =>

2. Run the script:
   =>bash
   python attendance_system.py
   =>

3. Press 'q' to exit the application.

## Project Structure

- `attendance_system.py`: The main script for capturing video frames, performing face recognition, and recording attendance.
- `faces/`: Folder containing images of known faces (e.g., `sudhanshu.jpg`, `deepak.jpg`, `mitthu.jpg`).
- `YYYY-MM-DD.csv`: CSV file for storing attendance records, named based on the current date.

## Configuration

- Modify the list of known faces (`known_face_encodings` and `known_face_names`) in the script to match your students.
- Adjust the camera index if needed (`VideoCapture(0)` uses the default camera).


## Acknowledgments

- [face_recognition]: Face recognition library used in the project.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): Computer vision library used for video capture and image processing.
